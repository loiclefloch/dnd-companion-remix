			// Second only to Strength. Barbarians take a lot of damage, so you need all the hit points you

			// It also helps when you must occasionally resort to using weapons.

			CON: AbilityImportance.OK,
			//  Several interesting skills rely on Intelligence, but if you don’t take any of those then its worthless..
			INT: AbilityImportance.OK,
			// Good for important saves and a handful of skills.
			WIS: AbilityImportance.OK,
			// The Bard runs on Charisma. Get as much as you can, as early as you can. Even if you’re splitting

			// afford more Strength since they can dump Dexterity, but it’s only strictly necessary if you 
			// want to avoid the speed penalty from heavy armor. Weapon attacks are mathematically a poor 
			// choice compared to cantrips, so there is very little reason to invest heavily in Strength 
			// and Strength-based weaponry.
			STR: AbilityImportance.OK,

			// option if you want to Shove enemies prone, but several monk subclasses already offer options 
			// to knock foes prone without resorting to Athletics.
			STR: AbilityImportance.OK,
			//  Dexterity rules the Monk. Almost all monks rely on Dexterity for attacks, so it sets your 
			// attacks, damage, and AC, and having good Dexterity will help avoid AOE damage which can quickly 
			// cut into your d8 hit points. Evasion helps, but it’s more effective you succeed on the save.
			DEX: AbilityImportance.FANTASTIC,
			// With only d8 hit dice, Constitution is very important for the Monk.
			CON: AbilityImportance.GOOD,
			// Generally dump, unless you really need to use knowledge skills.
			INT: AbilityImportance.BAD,
			// Wisdom fuels Monk’s AC and many of their special abilities. It notably sets the save DC for 
			// class features which allow targets to make saving throws, so it’s especially important for

			// The only exception is if you decide to use a polearm for some reason.
			STR: AbilityImportance.BAD,
			// Dexterity fuels the majority of what the Ranger does. Even for builds that aren’t 
			// Dexterity-based, you need at least 14 to fill out the Dexterity cap on Half Plate.

			// Strength-based rogues are technically possible. It’s usually a bad idea, but it is absolutely possible.
			STR: AbilityImportance.BAD,
			// Rogues run on Dexterity. They add to you skills, your tools, your attacks, your damage, your AC, and your best save.
			DEX: AbilityImportance.FANTASTIC,
			// Hit points are always important, especially for melee Rogues.
			CON: AbilityImportance.GOOD,
			// Arcane Tricksters need Intelligence for their spells, but other Rogues only need it for Investigation.
			INT: AbilityImportance.OK,
			// Helpful for Insight and Perception, but otherwise useless. Inquisitives will want a bit more 
			// to power Unerring Eye, but Expertise will outweight your ability modifier anyway so you don’t need much.

			// still easier to focus on Charisma.
			STR: AbilityImportance.BAD,
			// Melee Warlocks need 14 Dexterity to pad their AC, but Hexblades use Charisma for attack and 
			// damage. Other Warlocks still need some for AC.
			DEX: AbilityImportance.GOOD,
			// Everyone needs hit points. You don’t need a ton because you can depend on Fiendish Vigor for 
			// an easy hp boost, but you still don’t want to skimp on Constitution.
			CON: AbilityImportance.GOOD,
			// A bit for Knowledge skills is nice, but if you don’t have any you can dump it.
			INT: AbilityImportance.OK,

			STR: AbilityImportance.BAD,
			// A bit for AC is nice and Dexterity saves are common, but that’s all you get unless you go 
			// for Bladesinging, in which case you will want a bunch for the weapon that you’re going to use. 
			// You can limp along at low levels using a crossbow in place of offensive cantrips, but you don’t 
			// need to strain yourself to get 16 Dexterity. 14 will do fine.
			DEX: AbilityImportance.GOOD,
			// Hit points and Constitution saves are problems for Wizards. A wizard with less than 14 
			// Constitution is a choice to gamble with your life.
			CON: AbilityImportance.GOOD,
